LuaExpat is a XML parser based on the Expat XML parser.
It allows Lua programs to:

- Process a XML document incrementally , thus being able to handle huge documents without memory penalties; 

- Register handler functions wich are called by the parser during the processing of the document, handling the document elements or text.
