#Note: This include file is duplicated in squeezeplay/, squeezeplay_jive/, and squeezeplay_desktop/, so
# if you are making changes to it consider making the changes in each of the locations.
# The reason for the duplication (rather than a shared file) is that Poky checks out just subdirectory not the top level
