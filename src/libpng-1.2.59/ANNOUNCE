Changes since the last public release (1.2.58):

version 1.2.59 [September 28, 2017]
  Added PNGMINUS_UNUSED macro to contrib/pngminus/p*.c and added missing
    parenthesis in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c (bug report by Christian Hesse).
  Compute a larger limit on IDAT because some applications write a deflate
    buffer for each row (Bug report by Andrew Church).
  Initialize memory allocated by png_inflate to zero, using memset, to
    stop an oss-fuzz "use of uninitialized value" detection in png_set_text_2()
    due to truncated iTXt or zTXt chunk.
