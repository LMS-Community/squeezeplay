What's New

This is just a bug-fix/update release.

    * Improved: http.request() now supports deprecated HTTP/0.9
      servers (Florian Berger)
    * Fixed: could return "timedout" instead of "timeout" (Leo Leo)
    * Fixed: crash when reading '*a' on closed socket (Paul Ducklin);
    * Fixed: return values are consistent when reading from closed sockets;
    * Fixed: case sensitivity in headers of multipart messages in 
      smtp.message() (Graham Henstridge);
    * Fixed a couple instances of error() being called instead of base.error().       These would cause an error when an error was reported. :)  (Ketmar Dark);
    * Fixed: test script now uses pairs() iterator instead of the old 
      Lua syntax (Robert Dodier).
